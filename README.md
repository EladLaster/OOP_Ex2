*subject:*
          
            1)In the first part we will create several text files, and count the number of lines created in several different ways:
              normal method without the use of threads,method using threads and method using threadpool.
             
            2)In the second part we will create a new "Task" type that consists of an asynchronous operation and priority,
              and in addition we will also create a new  "ThreadPool" type that will prioritize the type of new tasks we built 
              - according to their priority.
            
## Get start 
1) Clone the repository:

                        git clone https://github.com/EladLaster/OOP_Ex2.git   
                                               
2) Open in any Java IDE.
 
3) In part 1: Create a number of new text files with a random number of lines and get the total number of lines of the texts
            by one of four existing methods/functions present in the class.

   In part 2: Bulid a new CustomExecutor and a new task with/without priority, send the task to the new CustomExecutor , submit the task         
           u create in the CustomExecutor and get the result of the task you sent to the program by considering the priority of the task.

4) Enjoy!!!

## RunTimes

We want to see that runtimes differ from method to method, and we want to understand which method is more efficient in terms of runtime
We can see that by running the ex2 program, it follows that working with Thrades and ThradePool is indeed faster than working without Thrades. This shows that indeed the calculation of lines of text in parallel is better than regular counting. This is obvious because counting rows performed all at once by several objects is faster than counting the lines one at a time.
You can also see that working with ThradePool is faster than working with Thrades, because when you create a Thradepool, he already produces a large number of Thrades himself that will be ready to receive tasks, instead of creating Thrades only when the task arrives.

In the following picture we can see the correctness of the claim by create a 5000 files.

## Adapter design pattern

the adapter pattern is a software design pattern that allows the interface of an existing class to be used as another interface.
It is often used to make existing classes work with others without modifying their source code.

Whenever we want to link an object to a task and there is no real connection between it and the object, we want to build an adapter that will cause an indirect connection between the object and the task that will pass through it. 
The correlation will make it possible to do this by inserting the values of the given object and adjusting them to the given task.

## Tests

### *part1 test:*

In this class, we will check the functions of the "Ex_1".
In the "createTextFiles" function, We would like to see that the number of files we asked a function to build has indeed been created.
In the "getNumOfLines" function, We would like to see that the number of rows in the created files does indeed match the number of rows that the function spends (normal method without the use of threads).
In the "getNumOfLinesThreads" function, We would like to see that the number of rows in the created files does indeed match the number of rows that the function spends (method using threads).
In the "getNumOfLinesThreadPool" function, We would like to see that the number of rows in the created files does indeed match the number of rows that the function spends (method using threadpool).

### *part2 test:*

In this class, we will check the functions of all the file we created.
We will introduce new "Tasks" that we have built into the new "CustomExecutor" that we have created, we will check that the results of the tasks are correct and that the "CustomeExecutor" perform the tasks according to the priority - from high to low.
