## Adapter design pattern




## classes part1

*Ex2:*

*Ex2_1:*

*Thread_Ex2:*

*ThreadP_Ex2:*




We will use the following functions in this class:

- _register()_- registers a new member to a GroupAdmin and adds him to the arrMember list.

- _unregister()_- unregister a specific member from the GroupAdmin and remove him from the arrMember list.

- _append()_- Inserts the string into this character sequence.

- _insert()_- Appends the specified string to the group.

- _delete()_- Delete the characters in a substring of this sequence.

- _undo()_- Cancels the last change that was made to the sequence and goes back to the previous sequence.

- _notify()_- notifies all the members in the GroupAdmin with any change that happens.
